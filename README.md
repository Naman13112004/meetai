# AI-Powered Video Call App - Meet AI

This project is a **full-stack AI-powered video conferencing application** that enables users to initiate real-time video calls, generate transcripts and summaries, view meeting recordings, and interact with a contextual AI chatbot post-meeting.

Built with the latest modern web stack and powered by the **Stream Video SDK**, this app demonstrates the integration of **custom AI agents**, **background job processing**, and **AI-enhanced meeting analysis**.

> 📌 **Note:** Due to monetary restrictions, certain premium features like real-time AI voice replies, transcript-based summaries, and contextual AI chat responses are currently non-functional. These features require paid OpenAI credits which are not integrated at this stage. Please bear with the limited functionality 🙏

## 🚧 Limitations

Due to budget constraints, this project does **not include OpenAI API integration** as of now. Therefore, the following features are disabled:

- Real-time agent voice interaction
- Meeting summarization
- Transcript-based contextual AI chatbot

These features are structured into the project and can be easily enabled once OpenAI or another LLM provider is integrated.
